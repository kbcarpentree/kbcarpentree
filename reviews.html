          “I am pleased to recommend KB Carpentry for residential construction and exterior improvement projects.  Becca and Keenan recently completed a new deck and a roof over the front door at my home and the quality of their work exceeded my expectations.

From the initial consultation through to project completion, they demonstrated professionalism, clear communication, and strong attention to detail. They offered helpful design suggestions during the planning stage and kept me informed throughout the build and ensured that the final structure was both durable and visually appealing.  Becca worked closely with their Structural Engineer and the Permitting Department resulting in a smooth approval process.

The craftsmanship of the deck and the new front-entry roof is excellent. The work was completed on schedule, the site was kept clean, and they showed great care and respect for my property.

Based on my experience, I confidently recommend KB Carpentry to anyone seeking reliable, skilled and customer-focused carpentry services. I would be happy to speak further about my project if additional information is needed.”

          “Becca & Keenan were absolutely incredible to work with on our roof & balcony project. 

They are the perfect blend of professional, friendly, knowledgeable, hard working & responsive.

Whenever my Wife & I had questions, they would not just answer us quickly, but often had great suggestions with ideas to make our vision even better.

We are very happy with our finished product and are extremely excited to enjoy our new space for many years to come.

I'd be more than happy to chat with anyone that is considering hiring Becca & Keenan for their project. I know I'll be bringing them back for projects in the future!”

          “Had a great experience with this company.  Excellent attention to detail, good end of the day clean up, crew showed up on time and staircase was finished on schedule and for the quoted price.  Becca and Keenan were very easy to work with and friendly, provided some good and important input into my plans which were appreciated.  Overall a great job and would never hesitate to recommend this honest company and companies like this are difficult to find these day.”
